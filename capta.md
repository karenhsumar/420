# Suspicious Activity Report Template

Who is conducting the suspicious activity?

While one section of the SAR calls for specific suspect information, the narrative should be
used to further describe the suspect or suspects, including occupation, position or title within
the suspect’s business, the nature of the suspect’s business (or businesses), and any other
information and identification numbers associated with the suspects.
What instruments or mechanisms are being used to facilitate
the suspect transactions?
A list of instruments or mechanisms that may be used in suspicious activity includes, but is
not limited to, funds transfers, letters of credit and other trade instruments, correspondent

accounts, casinos, structuring, shell companies, bonds or notes, stocks, mutual funds,
insurance policies, traveler’s checks, bank drafts, money orders, credit or debit cards, prepaid
cards, and digital currency business services. The SAR includes a number of check boxes to
record the instrument type(s)/payment mechanism(s) involved in the suspicious activity and
type(s) of suspicious activity being reported. FinCEN requests that banks check the
appropriate box(es) in the Suspicious Activity Information section and include certain key
terms in the narrative section of the SAR. If necessary, the instrument and type of suspicious
activity can be described in further detail in the narrative. If a SAR narrative summarizes the
flow of funds, the narrative should always include the source of the funds (origination) and
the use, destination, or beneficiary of the funds.

When did the suspicious activity take place?

If the activity takes place over a period of time, indicate the date when the suspicious activity
was first noticed and describe the duration of the activity. When possible, in order to better
track the flow of funds, individual dates and amounts of transactions should be included in
the narrative rather than only the aggregated amount.

Where did the suspicious activity take place?

The narrative should indicate where the suspicious activity took place. . The narrative should
also specify if the suspected activity or transactions involves a foreign jurisdiction.
Why does the filer think the activity is suspicious?
The SAR should describe, as fully as possible, why the activity or transaction is unusual for
the customer, considering the types of products and services offered by the filing bank’s
industry, and drawing any applicable contrasts with the nature and normally expected
activities of similar customers.

How did the suspicious activity occur?

The narrative should describe the “modus operandi” or the method of operation of the subject
conducting the suspicious activity. In a concise, accurate, and logical manner, the narrative
should describe how the suspect transaction or pattern of transactions was committed. For
example, if what appears to be structuring of currency deposits is matched with outgoing
funds transfers from the accounts, the SAR narrative should include information about both
the structuring and outbound transfers (including dates, destinations, amounts, accounts,
frequency, and beneficiaries of the funds transfers).
